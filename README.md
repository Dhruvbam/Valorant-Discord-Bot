# Hackwest23 - a 24 hour hackathon 

Introduction:

Valorant is a first person shooter game where you play as an agent, with a random map every match. 
It is currently played by over 18M players around the world

Every agent has their unique abilities.
I believe as of now we have 20 valo agents
I can keep going but I think and hope ive covered enough for the background needed to understand our project. 

Game tracker is a bot on discord which has 5 functionalities as of now and we intend to keep adding more of them.
We are following an agile development method so each time we add new functionalities/commands we can keep adding them to our bot.
We have deployed this bot on the Google Cloud Platform so it is scalable to a large scale

Commands and their uses:
/agent - Randomly selects an agent to play with.
/stratroulette -Randomly selects a type of gameplay for the team to play with.
/maptips - gives information and strategies for the map selected by the user
/agent_tips -gives information and strategies for the agent selected by the user
/shootingtips -gives the user shooting tips depending on his competitive rank in the game
