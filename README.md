# Valorant-Discord-Bot

## Hackwest23 Project - A 24 hour hackathon competition


Introduction:

For those new to valorant itâ€™s a 5v5, first person shooter game where you play as an agent. And it is currently played by over 18M players

Every agent has their unique abilities I believe as of now we have 20 valo agents The game picks a random map for your team to play and we have about 9 of them I can keep going but I think and hope ive covered enough for the background needed to understand our project.

Game tracker is a bot on discord which has 5 functionalities as of now and we intend to keep adding more of them. We are following an agile development method so each time we add new functionalities/commands we can keep adding them to our bot We have deployed this bot on GCP so it is available for use to everyone

Commands and their uses: /agent - Randomly selects an agent to play with. /stratroulette -Randomly selects a type of gameplay for the team to play with. /maptips - gives information and strategies for the map selected by the user /agent_tips -gives information and strategies for the agent selected by the user /shootingtips -gives the user shooting tips depending on his competitive rank in the game
